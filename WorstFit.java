/*
 * This Java program implements the Worst Fit memory allocation strategy, which
 * assigns processes to memory blocks based on the largest available block.
 * Letâ€™s walk through each part of the code and how it works.
 * 
 * Key Concepts
 * Memory Blocks: Fixed-size chunks of memory where processes can be allocated.
 * Processes: Each process requires a certain amount of memory to be allocated
 * to a block.
 * How the Worst Fit Strategy Works
 * Input Phase:
 * 
 * The user enters the number and sizes of memory blocks.
 * Then, the user enters the number of processes and their respective sizes.
 * Allocation Process:
 * 
 * For each process, the program finds the largest memory block that can
 * accommodate the process (i.e., "worst fit").
 * This is achieved by:
 * Checking each block to see if it is large enough to hold the current process.
 * If multiple blocks can fit the process, it picks the block with the largest
 * size, ensuring that smaller blocks remain available for potentially smaller
 * processes.
 * Once the block is selected, the program:
 * Allocates it to the process.
 * Reduces the block size by the process size to reflect the remaining memory in
 * that block.
 * Stores this remaining size in the remblockSize array for output.
 * Output Phase:
 * 
 * The program displays the results for each process:
 * Process number
 * Process size
 * Block number assigned (if allocated)
 * Remaining size of the block after allocation
 * If a process cannot be allocated to any block, it is marked as
 * "Not Allocated."
 * Example Walkthrough
 * Let's say you have 3 memory blocks and 2 processes:
 * 
 * Input:
 * Memory Blocks: 100, 500, 200
 * Processes: 150, 250
 * Execution:
 * Process 1 (150): Fits in the largest block (500), leaving 350 remaining.
 * Process 2 (250): Now fits in the largest remaining block (350 from the
 * previous allocation), leaving 100 remaining.
 * Code Explanation
 * worstFit function: Implements the worst-fit algorithm by finding the largest
 * suitable block for each process.
 * allocation array: Stores the block index allocated to each process (or -1 if
 * no block can accommodate the process).
 * remblockSize: Keeps track of the remaining size in each block after
 * allocation.
